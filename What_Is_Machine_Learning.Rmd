#- Definition

<span style="color:blue"> E: experience

<span style="color:blue"> T: task

<span style="color:blue"> P: performance 

<br>

  > a computer program learns from an **experience** with respect to some **task** and **performance**
  
<br>

*Example:*

**Experience**- computer watching you label spam emails
<br>
**Task**- classifying emails as spam or not
<br>
**Performance**: how well did the computer program classify spam/not spam?

<br>

#- Types of ML

<br>

Ml algorithms can be classified as either:

1- **Supervised Learning**

2- **Unsupervised Learning**

<br>

* **S**upervised Learning --> there is **structure** to your data set

* Unsupervised Learning --> there is **no** structure. Program looks for **clusters/patterns**

<br>

#- Supervised Learning

<br>

  > **REMEMBER**:  <span style="color:red"> structure in data set

<br>

##- <span style="color:blue"> Regression

<br>

* Outcome is <span style="color:blue"> continuous

<br>

  > Example/ Predicting the price of houses 
  
<br>

##- <span style="color:green"> Classification

<br>

* Outcome is <span style="color:green"> categorical

<br>

  > Example/ Base on the tumor size classify tumor as: i) Malignant or ii) Benign 
  
<br>

#- Unsupervised Learning

<br>

  > **REMEMBER**:  <span style="color:red"> there is NO structure in data set and you want the program to find **clusters/patterns**

<br>

  > Example/ grouping news articles into common themes/topics. You have a bunch of articles and want to group them into common topics (ie., sports, US politics, Entertainment, etc.)
